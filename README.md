Grand Blanc Highschool Sophomore Student
I am Grahish Arul, a young novice coder who is hoping to go places in the field of coding


 - I am working to expertise myself with any coding languages and the interfaces you are required to navigate to use them
 - I feel I am struggling to get myself set for learning coding, and by that I mean with finding proper resources to learn everything from the ground up
 - I am an NHS member with a 3.8+GPA and many extracurriculars
